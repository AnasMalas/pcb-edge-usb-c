This folder contains photos and videos from various tests done to confirm the capablilites of the connector. The file names are self descriptive, and many photos and videos included here are not seen on the main readme page. 

These tests were done with various USB C cables and multiple PCBs. The tested PCB is a 0.6 mm thick 4 layer board with ENIG from JLCPCB with the JLC04061H-2116 stackup. Your milage may vary.

One example of the differences can be see below is the single vs 110 mating cycle photos. I tested all the cards when I first got them, and wasnt sure which cable I used for that, but the contacts are well centered in that case when compared to the contacts in the cable I used for the 110 insertions
